## Overview

This add-on is for use with the Spanish translation of BP-BGT Worldmap. Using it gives you a worldmap with writing in Spanish.

You apply the add-on by placing the included :file_folder: *moz* folder in *bp-bgt-worldmap/language/spanish*. On Windows you can do this simply by extracting the add-on on top of the extracted contents of the main BP-BGT Worldmap package.
